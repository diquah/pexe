 Pexe is a way of packing a python project directory into a single file that feels like an executable (.exe) while still being actual python code.
 
 Pexe is ***not*** for you if:
 * You are trying to create a standalone executable.
 * Pexe is not on your client machine.
 * Python is not installed on your client machine.
